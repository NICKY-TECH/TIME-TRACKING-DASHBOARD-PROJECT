## My process

During the development process I took out time to go through the design and imagine the workflow before implementation.

1. I created my react project
2. I added my folder structure
3. Installed packages
4. Create a Repository
5. Implementation
6. Push to github
7. Edit Readme file
8. Host Project

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [classes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames)- Npm Package for conditionally adding classes

### What I learned

1. I learnt about the npm classenamenpm package

- It helps make your code more organized in terms of conditionally adding classes, this package handles it in a clear and precise way.

```jsx
<div
  className={classNames(
    "background-wrapper bg-no-repeat bg-right-top",
    { " bg-Work bg-brand-work": title === "Work" },
    { "bg-Play bg-brand-play": title === "Play" },
    {
      "bg-brand-study bg-Study": title === "Study",
    },
    {
      "bg-Exercise bg-brand-exercise": title === "Exercise",
    },
    {
      "bg-Social bg-brand-social": title === "Social",
    },
    {
      "bg-Self-Care bg-brand-selfCare": title === "Self Care",
    }
  )}
></div>
```
